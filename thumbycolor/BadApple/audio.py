#implements raw 4-bit IMA ADPCM using more or less the standard way
#files for this were preprocessed and downsampled in Audacity, and converted to IMA with SoX (Sound eXchange) as follows:
#sox inputfilename outputfilename.ima

#there is a slight tick every time a buffer is filled - I suspect that running the audio loop entirely in RAM will likely eliminate it.
#the only part that still runs from flash is setting the pulse width, but configuring PWM with raw register writes if a hassle so it's been left for now.
